## Quick Start

### Want to play with these notebooks online without having to install anything?

* <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/hanchen92/THU-STAT-BigData-113-1-6189/blob/main/" target="_parent"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/></a> (recommended)

âš  _Colab provides a temporary environment: anything you do will be deleted after a while, so make sure you download any data you care about._

Other services may work as well, but I have not fully tested them:

* <a href="https://homl.info/kaggle3/"><img src="https://kaggle.com/static/images/open-in-kaggle.svg" alt="Open in Kaggle" /></a>

* <a href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/hanchen92/THU-STAT-BigData-113-1-6189/HEAD?filepath=%2Findex.ipynb"><img src="https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg" alt="Launch binder" /></a>

* <a href="https://homl.info/deepnote3/"><img src="https://deepnote.com/buttons/launch-in-deepnote-small.svg" alt="Launch in Deepnote" /></a>

### Just want to quickly look at some notebooks, without executing any code?

* <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/hanchen92/THU-STAT-BigData-113-1-6189/blob/main/index.ipynb"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyter/design/master/logos/Badges/nbviewer_badge.svg" alt="Render nbviewer" /></a>

* [github.com's notebook viewer](https://github.com/hanchen92/THU-STAT-BigData-113-1-6189/blob/main/index.ipynb) also works but it's not ideal: it's slower, the math equations are not always displayed correctly, and large notebooks often fail to open.
